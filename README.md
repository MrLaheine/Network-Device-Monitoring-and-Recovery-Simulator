# Network-Device-Monitoring-and-Recovery-Simulator
Our project, a Network Device Monitoring and Recovery Simulator, provides a cost-effective and risk-free solution for IT teams and network administrators to simulate real-world network monitoring and recovery scenarios.
Since it does not require physical or virtual network devices, it allows organizations to train personnel, test configurations, and improve incident response strategies without impacting live networks:
1.	Develop a web-based MVP for simulating network monitoring and recovery.
2.	Create a REST API to manage and analyze virtual network configurations.
3.	Implement a comparison feature to detect deviations from baseline configurations.
4.	Enable rollback functionality for configuration recovery.
5.	Integrate Jenkins for automated testing of recovery scenarios.
6.	Ensure an intuitive UI for users to interact with simulated network devices.
